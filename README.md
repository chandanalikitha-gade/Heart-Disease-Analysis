❤️ Heart Disease Analysis using Data Analysis & Tableau

This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data to identify key risk factors and patterns that contribute to cardiovascular diseases. Using real-world healthcare datasets, the project applies data analysis techniques to clean, process, and explore patient data such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle indicators.

The analyzed data is visualized through interactive Tableau dashboards, enabling clear insights into trends, correlations, and high-risk groups. These visualizations help in understanding how different health parameters impact heart disease occurrence and support data-driven decision-making in the healthcare domain.
